### **Deep Learning Model Evaluations on Three Datasets**
This repository contains deep learning models trained and evaluated on three different datasets: **Iris, Wine Quality, and MNIST**. Each model demonstrates various performance metrics, including **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, ROC & PR curves, per-class analysis, and error visualization**.

### 📌 **Project Overview**
This project covers:
1. **Iris Dataset:** Multi-class classification using a deep neural network (DNN).
2. **Wine Quality Dataset:** Regression-based quality prediction using a neural network.
3. **MNIST Dataset:** Handwritten digit recognition using a CNN.

Each model includes:
✅ Model summary with architecture diagrams  
✅ Training and evaluation using TensorBoard  
✅ Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
✅ ROC & PR curves for multi-class classification  
✅ Per-class correct and incorrect examples  
✅ Confusion matrices for classification tasks
